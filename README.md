Weather Service using FastMCP & NWS API
This repository provides a straightforward weather service that fetches real-time weather alerts and forecasts directly from the trusted National Weather Service. Built with FastMCP and asynchronous HTTP requests via httpx, the code is designed to efficiently serve data for US states and geographic locations.

Key Features
Real-Time Alerts: Retrieve current weather alerts for a given US state by its two-letter code.
Detailed Forecasts: Get weather forecasts for specific coordinates with clearly formatted output.
Asynchronous Operations: Uses async HTTP calls to prevent blocking, ensuring faster responses and efficient resource use.
Improved Readability: Function names have been refactored (e.g., from get_alerts to retrieve_alerts) to clearly indicate their purpose.
Real-World Scenario
Imagine you're running a weather application that needs to deliver timely and accurate weather updates. This code directly taps into the National Weather Service API, a proven and reliable source of weather data. Recent advancements in asynchronous programming have made it possible to fetch data faster compared to old blocking methods. By using async HTTP calls, the service remains responsive even under heavy loads, a critical factor in modern performance-sensitive applications.

Evidence of Advancements
Async HTTP Requests: Modern applications favor asynchronous I/O to handle multiple network calls concurrently, reducing wait times.
Refactored Naming: Clear function names reduce cognitive load for new developers and improve maintainability, a best practice adopted by many current projects.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling ensures that the service fails gracefully, providing fallback messages if the NWS API is unreachable.
